//! In-process WireGuard for cmux clients.
//!
//! A cmux Cloud machine sits on its owner's private network and opens no
//! public port. Reaching its daemon therefore needs a WireGuard peer, and the
//! usual way to get one is a system interface: root on macOS, the
//! NetworkExtension entitlement plus a VPN prompt on iOS. This crate is the
//! alternative: the WireGuard peer and a small TCP/IP stack run inside the
//! client process, over one plain UDP socket. Only the client's own
//! connections travel through it, nothing else on the machine changes, and no
//! privilege is needed.
//!
//! Two sans-IO engines are wired together by one driver task:
//!
//! - [`boringtun::noise::Tunn`] holds the WireGuard session (handshake,
//!   encryption, timers, keepalive) and speaks in datagrams.
//! - `smoltcp` holds the IP interface and its TCP sockets and speaks in IP
//!   packets.
//!
//! The driver moves bytes between the underlay (one UDP socket, or several
//! paths to the same peer), the tunnel, and a virtual
//! device that smoltcp polls. Each TCP connection is bridged to a
//! [`WgStream`], which implements Tokio's `AsyncRead` and `AsyncWrite` so the
//! rest of the client cannot tell it apart from a kernel socket.
//!
//! Crypto-key routing is enforced on receive: a decrypted packet whose source
//! address lies outside the peer's `AllowedIPs` is dropped.
