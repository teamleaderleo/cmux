//! Split identities of the ids that only the side tables name: row 1 of a
//! column with rows, and the column of a lone column with rows.
//!
//! Every row id and column id is a split identity (plans/cmux-next/rows.md,
//! R4b: never reused). A build without `rows-v1` checks at open that the live
//! split identities are exactly the splits of each stored `layout_json` and
//! `viewport_json`, so an id that only the side tables name cannot be live.
//! It is parked: registered with kind `split`, tombstoned in
//! `resource_identities` (an older build sees a deleted split it never
//! reads), and flagged in `resource_parked_splits` with its screen. Only a
//! parked id is revived, when it enters its screen's stored projection again
//! (a lone column that gains a second column). An id that leaves its screen
//! loses the flag in the same commit: that tombstone is final.
