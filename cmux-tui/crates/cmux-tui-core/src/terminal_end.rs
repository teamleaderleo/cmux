//! How a hosted terminal's run ended, as far as the owner can prove.
//!
//! Invariant 3 of plans/cmux-next/OWNERSHIP-PRINCIPLES.md: a terminal host's
//! death never closes a workspace or removes a tab; the tab becomes dead.
//! Only a process end (an observed exit status or signal) may detach a
//! terminal's tabs, subject to the keep policies, and only an explicit close
//! removes them otherwise. [`DetachProof`] is the type that carries this
//! rule: the exit-detach projection takes one, and only
//! [`TerminalEnd::ProcessEnded`] and [`TerminalEnd::LaunchFailed`] (the
//! owner abandoning its own unpublished launch, an explicit close) yield
//! one; [`TerminalEnd::HostLost`] never does.
//!
//! The durable exit receipt keeps its existing schema (`outcome`,
//! `exited_at`, `revision`), so older registries open unchanged and older
//! daemons can still read newer ones. A receipt carries no provenance, so a
//! persisted end is classified by its outcome: `exit` and `signal` are
//! process ends; `unknown` is a host loss.
