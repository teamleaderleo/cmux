"""A workflow that filters both `push` and `pull_request` must filter them alike.

A workflow that names its inputs twice has two lists that can disagree, and
neither pull request that made them disagree can see it. When the `push` list is
the smaller one the failure is silent and expensive: a file is guarded on pull
requests, passes, merges, and is then unguarded on main forever.

Divergence that a maintainer genuinely wants goes in EXEMPTIONS with a reason,
so it is written down rather than implied by a list that looks like a typo.
