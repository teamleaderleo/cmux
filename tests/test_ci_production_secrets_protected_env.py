"""Jobs that hold production secrets run only from protected refs.

A workflow_dispatch run takes the workflow file and the code from whatever
ref the dispatcher picks, so any condition written in the workflow can be
edited away on a branch. GitHub enforces an environment's deployment branch
policy outside the workflow: these jobs declare the `release` environment
(policy: branch main, tags v*), or a cloud-vm environment with its own
policy, and their production secrets live in that environment.

The iroh release gate checks out a requested ref; its job with production
Stack credentials also requires that ref to be the run's own revision.
