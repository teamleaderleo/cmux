/**
 * Owner hygiene (home-messaging.md section 10), run by the ConversationDO alarm as the system op
 * `conversation.sweep` with no params, so it commits like any op (ledger, event with row
 * deletes, outbox) and mirrors drop the same rows:
 *
 * - Retention: with `retention_days`, messages older than that are deleted oldest first, at most
 *   RETENTION_BATCH per commit (the alarm comes back at once while more are due). The search
 *   projection gets one `home.message.delete_through {conversation_id, seq}` row per commit
 *   (home-scale.md B7), not one delete per message. When the newest message goes, every current
 *   human gets an inbox bump with an empty preview, so no expired text stays in an inbox.
 *   Deleted messages a human had not read leave that human's stored counts (TABLE_UNREAD), the
 *   same as a retract, and that human gets a bump carrying the lower counts (never below what
 *   the remaining messages hold, see countsAfter). Stored counts of humans who left are dropped.
 * - Invites: open invites past `expires_at` become `expired` and their addresses are released,
 *   the same rule every invite op applies lazily (invite-ops.ts closeExpired).
 *
 * The op decides from `ctx.now` and the rows only; the host chooses when to run it with
 * `nextSweepAt`. A sweep with nothing due changes nothing (no event).
