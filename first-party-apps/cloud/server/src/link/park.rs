//! Ops that need a link never block the serve loop. When an op (a connect,
//! a port forward, a browser route, a file transfer) needs a link that is
//! still connecting, the link's `connect` parks it: the op answers nothing
//! yet, and the loop runs it again (same request, same key) when that link
//! generation is up or ended. Its result line then goes out before the
//! link line of the same change. Only the loop thread runs, parks and
//! re-runs ops; nothing here waits.
