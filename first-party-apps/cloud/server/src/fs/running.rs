//! Running file transfers: the copy runs on its own worker thread, off the
//! op loop. The op answers at once with a transfer id; the worker sends
//! one completion through a channel and wakes the loop, and the loop (the
//! only writer of transfer state) finishes the transfer: it closes the
//! one-shot route, publishes a pull, and queues a
//! `cloud.file.transfer.changed` event. At most [`MAX_TRANSFERS`] run at
//! once; more are refused (retryable), nothing queues.
