//! LOCAL MIRROR of `cmux.terminal.connector/1` (host mode), as landed in
//! cmux-tui/crates/cmux-app-host/interfaces/cmux.terminal.connector/1.json:
//! `connect {kind, target, open_token} -> {channel, window_bytes}`,
//! `close {channel}`, and `end {channel, lost: {reason, retryable}}`.
//!
//! The ghostty-next lead owns the real interface and the Rust traits
//! (plans/cmux-next/ghostty-next-switch.md 3.2 to 3.4, module
//! `terminal_backend` in cmux-tui-core). The traits are not on
//! feat-cmux-next yet. The types the connector shares with
//! `cmux.terminal.backend/1` (local ids, registry ids, the typed errors,
//! `open_token`) come from the one backend mirror in
//! [`crate::rescue::iface`], so there is one copy of each rule. When the
//! real crate lands, delete both mirrors and import the real types; keep
//! the names so the swap stays mechanical.
//!
//! Differences from the real shape, on purpose:
//! - Synchronous. The Cloud server is a single-threaded op loop with no async
//!   runtime. The real traits are `async fn`; each method here maps 1:1.
//! - Events are drained with `take_events` instead of a `BoxStream`.
//! - One queue, two sides: the supervisor's events have one consumer
//!   (`Attach::drain_link_events`), which gives each event to the serve
//!   loop's `cloud.link.changed` lines and to this connector's `end` queue.
//! - GAP(data plane): the landed channel is a viewer-protocol byte stream
//!   on the app host's stream (`data`/`credit`/`end` frames with offsets).
//!   The app host has no stream for native servers yet, so [`HostLink`] also
//!   exposes the [`Carrier`]: the link's local socket, which the daemon
//!   dials. `window_bytes` is the window the frames will start with.
