//! Replay records of mutations (OWNERSHIP-PRINCIPLES invariant 5: replaying
//! an op with the same key has no further effect).
//!
//! An attempt is recorded before the Cloud API call, so the same key with
//! another op or other args is a conflict even after a failure. A success
//! also records the result, which a retry gets back with no call. A failed or
//! lost call may be retried with the same key: the Cloud API dedups create,
//! restore and fork by the derived key [`upstream_key`]. The ledger lives as
//! long as the server process (data class `ephemeral`).
