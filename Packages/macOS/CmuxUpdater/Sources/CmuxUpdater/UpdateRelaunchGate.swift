///   has touched the keyboard or mouse for ``quietPeriod``. There is no timeout; until then the
///   pill offers Install Now, and quitting cmux still installs the update.
/// - ``Mode/askUser``: the user asked to install while something is risky. The popover lists
///   the agents and offers Wait, Update When These Finish, and Update Anyway. It never
///   relaunches on its own.
/// - ``Mode/whenClear``: the user chose Update When These Finish. It relaunches as soon as
///   nothing is risky.
///
/// Before relaunching on its own, the gate asks the host to prepare (a fresh session capture,
/// so every agent is saved with its resume binding), then checks again, because an agent can
/// start a command or the user can come back while the capture runs.
///
/// While holding, the gate publishes ``UpdateState/installing(_:)`` carrying the current
/// ``UpdateRelaunchBlockers``. Install Now / Update Anyway and Later / Wait are that state's
/// `retryTerminatingApplication` and `dismiss` actions; Update When These Finish is
