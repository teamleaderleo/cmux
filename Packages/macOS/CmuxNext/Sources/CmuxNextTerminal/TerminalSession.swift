/// One terminal on screen: a Ghostty surface fed by a ``TerminalIO``.
///
/// Embed ``view``. The session consumes `io.events` on the main actor,
/// feeds bytes through a serial off-main output lane, and writes Ghostty's
/// encoded input back to `io.write` in order. Consumption is demand-driven:
/// the next event is taken only once the lane has room, so a slow parser
/// pushes back on the IO (which bounds its own buffer) instead of queueing
/// without limit (state-audit.md T1).
///
/// Geometry: the mirror's grid must equal the PTY's grid at every point in
/// the byte stream, or later output lands in the wrong cells. The IO owner
/// decides the PTY size; every `.resize` event locks the live surface's grid
/// in place (`ghostty_surface_set_grid`, queued on the output lane behind
/// every earlier chunk), and never replaces the surface. Once one arrived the surface
/// renders only `.resize` grids (``TerminalGridPolicy``). When
/// ``ownsGeometry`` is true the grid the view fits is sent with `io.resize`,
/// once per change, as a request: the surface follows when the owner
/// announces the grid it applied. A request the owner does not apply
/// (another client holds geometry) never shows as a grid the PTY does not
/// have. An IO that never sends `.resize` (a bare PTY, resized by the
/// request itself) keeps the surface sized to the view.
