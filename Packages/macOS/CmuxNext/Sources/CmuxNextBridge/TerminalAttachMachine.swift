/// A view is never closed because its stream ended or an attach failed: it
/// is `disconnected`, keeps its last screen, and re-attaches on the next
/// event that can make an attach work (shown again, a key press, a click or
/// focus, the terminal or the connection back). One re-attach at a time. A
/// re-attach after a failed re-attach waits the capped backoff first
/// (`openAfterBackoff`); nothing retries on a timer. A terminal whose
/// process ended is `exited` and never re-attaches on a view event; only the
/// daemon reporting the terminal running again (`processRevived`) re-attaches
/// it, because a dead report can be transient (R41).
///
/// Rules the reducer enforces, whatever order events arrive in:
/// - Input typed before the replay (first attach or reattach) is queued and
///   sent once, in order, right after the replay. Input never goes to a link
///   that has not delivered its replay or that has ended.
/// - Grid reports before the replay are coalesced: only the latest size is
///   sent, after the replay, followed by the geometry claim when visible.
/// - Every link that was opened is detached exactly once: on overflow, on
///   close, or when its open completes after the machine moved on.
/// - Geometry follows the latest active client: the most recently active
///   client holds it. A visible view claims when it is shown, on every
///   settled resize, and, after the stream announced a grid other than the
///   one it reported (another client sized the terminal), on its next key
///   press or focus. A hidden view never claims.
///

/// Effects must be applied in the order returned, and batches in the order
/// the reducer produced them (``TerminalAttachDriver`` does both).
