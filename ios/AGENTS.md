# ios/ agent instructions

iOS app-target work in this directory follows `Packages/iOS/AGENTS.md`,
including its Apple Human Interface Guidelines rule. Read it before changing
UI.

Script paths below are relative to the repository root.

## iOS builds open on the iPhone by default

Any work verified by opening the iOS app installs BOTH an isolated-simulator build AND the same build on the user's iPhone. Never stop at simulator-only. Use `ios/scripts/reload.sh --tag <tag>` (with a `cmuxterm-hq` worktree, `ios/scripts/reload-cloud.sh --tag <tag>` may be available instead); with a default iPhone configured (`CMUX_IPHONE_DEVICE_ID` or `~/.config/cmux/iphone-device-id`) the device leg is automatic, and `--device-id <id>` still overrides (`xcrun devicectl list devices`). Physical iPhone builds always select the `personal` auth profile. Agent-driven Simulator verification always selects `agent`. Both named profiles live in `~/.secrets/cmuxterm-dev.env`; neither may fall back to the other. The simulator leg uses the tag's own isolated device `cmux-dev-<slug>`, created on demand; do not target a shared or user-visible simulator.

**Every phone install MUST be authenticated before handoff. Installed-but-signed-out is a failed install.** A tagged bundle id can retain an older account, so every authenticated launch clears that tagged session, signs both surfaces into the selected profile, verifies the exact tagged Mac account through `auth status`, then mints the pairing ticket. The iPhone auth gate passes only after the same-account host accepts the phone RPC and emits `mobile.rpc.ready`. `scripts/verify-iphone-auth.sh --tag <tag> [--device-id <id>]` repeats the Mac-account check, relaunches the phone without credentials, and passes only when persisted phone state reconnects. Never install with raw `devicectl device install app`, and never pass `--no-sign-in`/`--no-attach`/`--no-setup` for a dogfood build. The scripts refuse those device paths unless a human sets `CMUX_ALLOW_UNAUTHENTICATED_INSTALL=1`. If setup fails, report the gate reason and exact retry command.

Every phone build requires the same-tag Mac dev build (the iOS app is unusable without its Mac). The reload scripts build the Mac tag first when it is missing and refuse to ship a phone-only build if that fails; do not bypass this with `CMUX_IOS_SKIP_MAC_BUILD_CHECK` in normal work.

If the iPhone is unreachable at build time, the signed build is parked in `scripts/iphone-install-queue.sh`. Each entry stores the chosen profile, normalized account, and credentials-file path. Drain revalidates that snapshot before device mutation and uses installed stable copies of the launcher and auth helpers, so an old or pruned feature worktree cannot change policy. Install or refresh that control plane with `scripts/install-iphone-queue-agent.sh install`. Report `scripts/iphone-install-queue.sh list` in the handoff; `drain` retries delivery and `clear` abandons a queued build.

## Cross-tag Mac access for DEV iPhone builds

A DEV iPhone build pairs only with the Mac DEV build sharing its tag. When a task needs
the phone to also see other Mac dev builds (multi-Mac verification, dogfooding another
task's Mac from an existing phone build), grant those tags at runtime through the
same-tag Mac's debug socket instead of rebuilding or re-pairing the phone:

```bash
CMUX_TAG=<phone-tag> scripts/cmux-debug-cli.sh mobile compatible-tags add <mac-tag> [more-tags]
CMUX_TAG=<phone-tag> scripts/cmux-debug-cli.sh mobile compatible-tags list
CMUX_TAG=<phone-tag> scripts/cmux-debug-cli.sh mobile compatible-tags remove <mac-tag>
CMUX_TAG=<phone-tag> scripts/cmux-debug-cli.sh mobile compatible-tags clear
```

The grant set persists on that Mac and on the phone (per phone build tag), pushes live
to a connected phone, and otherwise applies on the phone's next connect. Removing a tag
disconnects and hides that Mac on the phone. Release lanes (`default`, `nightly`, `rc`,
`staging`) are never grantable, and only the phone's exact-tag Mac can change its grant
set. Use this whenever the user asks to let another Mac dev build connect to their
iPhone build; do not mint a shared tag or rebuild the phone for that.

## iOS dev auth

`~/.secrets/cmuxterm-dev.env` is the primary mobile dev credential file; agent launches without an explicit `--credentials-file` may fall back to `~/.secrets/cmux.env`. `CMUX_DOGFOOD_STACK_*` is the `personal` profile for physical iPhone dogfood. `CMUX_UITEST_STACK_*` is the `agent` profile for isolated Simulators. Run `scripts/setup-team-dev.sh` once to verify and merge the personal pair without deleting the agent pair. Use `scripts/mobile-dev-launch.sh --check-auth-contract --auth-profile personal` or `--auth-profile agent` for a mutation-free preflight. Never substitute one profile when the requested profile is incomplete.
