# cmux-next Chief on the Mac: the Rust brain (package P1)

Status: design note, P1 lead, 2026-10-03. Decisions: H8 (Rust port in cmux, in-process with the
conversation owner and acpmux; the TypeScript brain stays for the cloud MuxDO; one shared behavior
corpus), D10 (local conversations; promotion to a `ConversationDO`), IOS2. Inputs: home.md sections
4, 5 and 8, home-messaging.md section 20, code-mode.md, mcp.md, `mux/host`, `mux/packages/brain`.
Not in scope: decision X1 (the isolated chief experiment with its own memory model, Worker and
branch). This note does not use or change anything from X1.

## 1. What the brain is

The Chief is an ACP agent session (`mux` in acpmux, harness `claude-sr`). The model loop runs in the
harness. The "brain" that P1 ports is the deterministic host around it (today `mux/host`, Bun):

1. Inbox: it reads the conversation owner's `conversation-changed` events, applies the wake rule
   (home.md section 5), and prompts the session (`promptId` = message id).
2. Replies: it folds the session's acpmux events into turns and posts each turn's text as
   `message.send` by `agent_mux` (key `turn:<session>:<turn seq>`, or `turn:<session>:<epoch>:<turn
   seq>` after the acpmux log was reset; the epoch comes from the log itself, so a lost host.json or a
   repeated import never reuses a key); it sets typing during a turn.
3. Supervisor: it tracks child sessions tagged `mux.parent=mux`, posts and edits their `work`
   cards, and sends `[mux-event]` prompts when a child ends a turn or asks for a permission.
4. Outbox: durable, ordered conversation ops; one retry after `agent_rate`; drop on any other
   reject; reconnect and keep the entry on `actor_mismatch`.
5. Memory: the OptMem-style log (`LOG.txt`, `TREE/`), the Claude Code hooks that write it, and
   compaction through a summarizer session.
6. Session setup: the session directory (CLAUDE.md, `.claude/settings.json`, hooks), the tool
   servers, the host lock, and catch-up after a reconnect.

## 2. Process placement

Today the conversation owner (`cmux-conversation` + `conversation_store.rs`) runs in the session
daemon (`cmux` server). The acpmux hub runs in a second process from the same binary
(`cmux acp daemon run`). S8 puts both roles in the one `cmux` binary, but not yet in one process.

Placement: the Chief is an actor in the session daemon process (the conversation owner's process).

- Conversations: in-process calls to the store through a trait `ConversationPort`. The owner stamps
  `agent_mux` directly on the actor's writes. No socket, no minted token, no token file.
- acpmux: a trait `AgentSessionPort`. Its first implementation is the Rust acpmux client
  (`acpmux::client`) over the acpmux socket. The daemon starts `<current exe> acp daemon run` when the
  socket does not answer (the same rule as `ACPMUX_BIN` today, without the env var). When the acpmux
  hub moves into the daemon process (S8 hosting change, not P1), a second implementation calls the
  hub in-process. The core does not change.
- Lifecycle: the daemon starts the actor when the session has a `kind: home` workspace
  (`workspace.ensure_home`) and stops it with the session. One actor per `$MUX_HOME`: the actor takes
  the same kernel lock as the TypeScript host, so the two hosts never run together. Lock protocol:
  open `$MUX_HOME/state/host.lock` and take an exclusive non-blocking flock(2) (TypeScript: bun:ffi
  `flock(LOCK_EX|LOCK_NB)`; Rust: `std::fs::File::try_lock`, which is flock on Unix), keep the
  descriptor open for the host's life, never remove the file; the text `<pid>\n<start ms>\n` is
  diagnostics only, with a `flock` mark line (branch feat-cmux-next-mux-lock). Upgrade check, REMOVE
  AFTER ONE RELEASE: a lock text without the mark that names a live process whose OS start is no
  later than the recorded start (or the file mtime) plus 1 s is an older host that holds the lock by
  text only; the new host logs its pid and does not start. The Rust shell must write the same text
  with the `flock` mark line, or a TypeScript host reads it as an older host. The daemon advertises
  capability `chief-v1`.
- Why not the acpmux process: the conversation owner is the single writer of conversations and its
  owner-stamped actor is the security boundary (home.md section 2). An in-process client of the
  owner removes the token handoff (the 0600 file and the "any same-uid process is user_local" gap
  stays only for other clients). acpmux sessions are already a client protocol with replayable
  events and `promptId` dedupe, so a socket hop there costs nothing in correctness.

DECISION (to main): placement in the session daemon process now, with the acpmux hop behind a
trait. RECOMMEND: yes, because H8 asks for in-process with both owners and the conversation owner is
the one whose boundary matters; merging the acpmux hub into the daemon process is the S8 hosting
change and belongs to its own owner.

## 3. Core shape: one pure core, two hosts

Both brains get the same sans-I/O core: `step(state, input, now) -> effects`. Hosts do only I/O.

- TypeScript: `mux/packages/brain/src/core/` (extracted from `mux/host/src/host.ts`, `turns.ts`,
  `wake.ts`, `supervisor.ts`, `state.ts`). `mux/host` becomes a thin shell around it. The cloud
  MuxDO uses the same core later (H8 keeps the TypeScript brain for the cloud).
- Rust: crate `cmux-tui/crates/cmux-chief` (core, memory, prompts; serde only, no I/O), plus the
  daemon shell `cmux-tui-core/src/server/chief/` (ports, timers, persistence).

Inputs (tagged `kind`): `daemon_connected {conversation}`, `conversations_listed {conversations}`,
`snapshot {conversation, messages}`, `history {conversation, messages}`, `conversation_changed
{conversation, change}`, `op_result {idempotency_key, reason?, change?}` (`reason` set on a reject),
`acpmux_connected {session_id, sessions, events, cursor_reset?}`, `acpmux_event {event}`,
`session_changed {session}`, `permission_pending {session_id, permission_id, request}`,
`sessions {sessions}`, `child_events {session_id, events}`, `prompt_settled {prompt_id}`,
`timer {key}`, `disconnected {port}`. Every input carries `now` in milliseconds since the epoch. A
failed daemon read (list, snapshot, history) is reported as `disconnected {port: daemon}`; the
reconnect catches up again.

Effects (tagged `kind`, in order): `persist {state}` (first, when the step changed the durable
state; the shell writes it before it runs the rest), `conversation_op {conversation,
idempotency_key, op}`, `typing {conversation, on}`, `prompt {prompt_id, text}`, `list_conversations`,
`fetch_snapshot {conversation, tail}`, `fetch_history {conversation, before_seq, limit}`,
`fetch_sessions`, `fetch_child_events {session_id, after}`, `reconnect {port}`, `arm_timer {key,
at}`, `ready`, `log {line}`.

Durable state keeps the `host.json` shape of `mux/host/src/state.ts` (field names unchanged), so
the Rust host takes over a TypeScript host's state and memory with no migration step.

Conditions (Home lead, 2026-10-03, binding for P1):

1. The TypeScript step core is the single behavior source. The corpus is generated from it; the
   Rust core follows it, never the other way.
2. `mux/host` keeps working until `cmux-chief` passes the corpus; then the Rust Chief replaces it in
   one switch. The Mac never has two live brains (the shared kernel lock also enforces this).
3. The Rust Chief acts as `agent_mux` with the agent principal, never `user_local` or the install
   principal. In-process (section 2) the owner stamps the agent principal directly; any socket
   client path binds with the minted agent token.
4. Approval cards show the real op and params; the action key is derived from the confirm id,
   inside the core (a later core feature, built in TypeScript first).
5. No new raw daemon command lands without a coordination line in the lane file.

## 4. Shared behavior corpus

Format `cmux-chief-corpus/1`, file `mux/packages/brain/conformance/chief-cases.json`, written by
`mux/packages/brain/conformance/generate.ts` (the home-core pattern: each case states its intent,
the TypeScript core must agree, and the generator records the full effects).

```
{"format": "cmux-chief-corpus/1",
 "cases": [{"name", "state": <durable state before>,
            "steps": [{"now": <ms since the epoch>, "input": <Input> | "input_text": <wire text>,
                       "effects": [<Effect>]}],
            "state_after": <durable state>}],
 "memory": [{"name", "fn": "to_lines"|"decompose"|"wake_cover"|"wake"|"zoom", "args", "result"}]}
```

JSON text rule (coordinator, 2026-10-03): JSON that the cores render into prompt text (a
permission's `rawInput`, the `turn_error` fallback) uses sorted keys in both languages. Number text
still differs for integer-valued floats (TypeScript `1`, Rust `1.0`). This gap is accepted: corpus
cases carry no floats in that JSON, one unit test per language pins the current text, and no code
compares that text across the cores (compare parsed values only).

Wire counts (P1 v2, 2026-10-03): JSON has one number type, so a seq, at or log id written as an
integer-valued float (`1.0`, `3e0`) is that integer in both cores (JavaScript `JSON.parse` reads it
so; the Rust reader accepts it). A step with `input_text` carries its input as wire text that each
core parses with its own JSON reader, so the corpus can pin number text a JSON value cannot carry.

Rules: effects compare as exact JSON values in order (`log` effects are not compared); `persist` compares the whole state; times come only
from `now`. Case groups: wake rule (1:1, group, DM, mention, reply to the Chief, retracted, own
message), catch-up from the read cursor with paging, turn folding (steer, queue, error, replay at or
below the cursor), reply keys, typing, outbox (`agent_rate` once, `agent_budget` drop,
`actor_mismatch` keep and reconnect), children (start, permission, finish, lost on reconnect),
memory functions. Rust runs it with `include_str!` in `cmux-chief/tests/corpus.rs`; TypeScript runs
it in `bun test`. A required check runs both (the corpus is the contract, like
`cmux-conversation-conformance/1`).

## 5. Tools come from the catalog

No hand-written tool list. The Chief's verbs become catalog operations in
`cmux-tui/spec/resource-operations-v2.json`, owner `chief` (session daemon), with `cli.path`, so the
CLI verbs and the MCP tools are generated like every other operation:

| op | class | replaces |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `chief.agent.spawn {name, cwd, harness?, policy?, prompt}` | mutation, idempotency key | `mux agents spawn` |
| `chief.agent.prompt {name, text}` | mutation | `mux agents prompt` |
| `chief.agent.list {}` | read | `mux agents list` |
| `chief.permission.answer {name, option_id? , deny?}` | mutation | `mux agents allow/deny` |
| `chief.memory.recall {pattern, limit}` / `zoom {lo, hi}` / `wake {budget}` | read | `mux memory` |
| `chief.memory.note {text}` | mutation | `mux memory note` |
| `chief.compact {}` | mutation | `mux compact` |
| `chief.status {}` | read | none (health: lock, ports, outbox depth) |

The Chief's session gets one MCP server, `cmux mcp serve --profile chief`. A profile is a filter on
catalog fields (an operation with `agents.chief: true`), never a list of names. The profile holds
the `chief.*` ops and the workspace, tab, terminal and browser ops the curated CLI offers. When the
code-mode executor ships on macOS (code-mode.md: needs a macOS sandbox profile), the profile switches
to the two code-mode tools (`cmux_docs`, `cmux_exec`) over the same generated SDK; the Chief's rights
do not change. Claude Code hooks are not tools: they call `cmux chief hook <event>` (stdin JSON),
which runs in the daemon's memory owner. The CLAUDE.md section about tools is generated from the
profile (group names and one line each), so the prompt and the tool list cannot disagree.

## 6. `conversation.promote` (D10)

A local conversation becomes a cloud `ConversationDO` through lane 15's `conversation.import`
(home-messaging.md section 22). The local owner stays the single writer of the local copy; the
cloud owner is the single writer of the new one. The promoting user drives it from the app (it
holds the account session); an agent never promotes.

1. Local `conversation-promote-begin {conversation}` (actor `user_local`): the owner refuses a
   conversation whose participants are not `user_local` plus agents of this Mac (`not_promotable`),
   then freezes it (state `promoting`; every write refused with `promoting`) and returns the summary
   and this daemon's host id. The app pages the frozen messages with `conversation-history`.
2. The app maps `user_local` to the account's `user_<id>` and `agent_mux` to the user's default
   chief id (section 9) before the call, and sends `conversation.import` with `source {kind: mac,
   host, local_id}` and `kind: chief` (the owner and one owned mux agent) or `group`. The Worker
   derives the cloud id from the signed-in user, host and local id; the app never chooses it.
   Batches hold at most 500 messages and 1 MiB, in seq order (`after_seq` continues). Resume after a
   crash: the same first call returns `{last_seq, state}` and the app continues after `last_seq`.
   Then `conversation.import.commit {id, last_seq}`.
3. Local `conversation-promote-commit {conversation, cloud_id}`: the local copy becomes read-only
   with `promoted_to`. `conversation-promote-abort {conversation}` unfreezes it when the import is
   refused (for example while chief imports fail closed, before the backend lead adds the
   owner-record participant policy).

The Chief follows the pointer: it stops waking on the local copy; the cloud brain owns the cloud
copy. The local ops are daemon protocol changes (review subagent, cmux-tui window).

## 7. Migration and landing order

1. This note (plans only).
2. TypeScript: extract the core into `mux/packages/brain/src/core/`, keep `mux/host` green on the
   core, add the corpus generator and cases. No cmux-tui change; no window.
3. Rust: crate `cmux-chief` (core, memory, prompts) and its corpus test. Needs a cmux-tui window.
4. Daemon shell, capability `chief-v1`, `chief.*` catalog ops, `cmux chief` CLI, MCP profile,
   `cmux chief hook`. Needs a window and a review subagent (daemon, protocol, catalog).
5. App: `HomeBrainHost` stops reading `CMUX_NEXT_MUX_HOST` when the daemon advertises `chief-v1`
   (the daemon starts the Chief; the app mints no token). Swift via nx-remote. The env-var path is
   deleted after the next pin carries `chief-v1`.
6. `conversation.promote` after `conversation.import` and Home ops routing exist.

Done when: a tagged build answers in Home with no `CMUX_NEXT_MUX_HOST`; the corpus passes in
`bun test` and in `cargo test -p cmux-chief`; promote passes an end-to-end test against staging.

## 8. Open points

- Name: the wire ids stay `agent_mux`, acpmux session `mux` and `$MUX_HOME` so that the corpus and
  the state carry over. Product copy says Chief (IOS4). A rename of wire ids needs its own decision.
- Compaction keeps the acpmux summarizer session (`MUX_COMPACT_HARNESS`, model `haiku`). Model
  calls in tests go through the subrouter only.
- PATH for the Chief's tools stays the phase A stand-in until D26 (daemon login environment).

## 9. Chief records in UserDO (for the backend lead)

Record `chief` in `UserDO`, keyed by chief id. All fields are per user; P1 needs no per-install
field (the Mac's local Chief is the participant `agent_mux` of that install's local owner, mapped at
promote time to the user's default chief).

| field | type | null | writer | note |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `id` | `agent_<26 base32>` | no | UserDO at create | never reused |
| `owner_user` | `user_<id>` | no | UserDO at create | immutable |
| `display_name` | string, 1...100 chars | no | user (`chief.create`, `chief.update`) | default "Chief" |
| `is_default` | bool | no | user; UserDO keeps exactly one true | texts (H9) and promote use the default |
| `brain` | `"cloud"` | no | UserDO at create | the brain that answers this chief's cloud conversations; only `"cloud"` in P1 (the Mac brain answers local conversations only) |
| `main_conversation` | `conv_<26>` | yes | UserDO when it creates the chief's main conversation | |
| `harness` | string | yes | user | null = deployment default |
| `rev` | u64 | no | UserDO | +1 per committed op |
| `created_at`, `updated_at` | RFC 3339 ms | no | UserDO | |
| `archived_at` | RFC 3339 ms | yes | UserDO on `chief.archive` | |

Ops (actor: the user's principal, from any install; the Mac Chief actor and the cloud MuxDO write
none of these fields in P1, they only read `id`, `is_default` and `main_conversation`):

| op | params | idempotency key | risk class | rules |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `chief.create` | `display_name?`, `is_default?` | required; the first default chief uses the fixed key `chief-default` | normal | the first chief of a user is the default |
| `chief.update` | `chief`, `expected_rev`, `display_name?`, `is_default?`, `harness?`, `archived?` (false only: restore) | required | normal | setting `is_default` clears it on the old default in the same commit |
| `chief.archive` | `chief`, `expected_rev` | required | destructive (text confirmation per H10, H11) | refused for the default chief (`chief_is_default`) |

Retention: an archived chief stays readable and restorable (`chief.update` with `archived: false`)
for 30 days, then becomes a tombstone `{id, owner_user, archived_at}` kept forever so the id is never
reused; its conversations keep the participant (marked left). Memory deletion follows P2's memory
owner, not this record.

Presence: the Mac Chief does not need presence or the presence key.

## 10. Memory scope in the UI

One Chief identity spans the Mac and the cloud, but each brain keeps its own memory until P2 (Chief
memory in the team VM); accepted by the coordinator, 2026-10-03. Every view that shows the Chief
says so plainly. String for the Home lead's views (Mac and iOS), key
`home.chief.memoryScope.deviceOnly`: en "This Chief remembers on this device only.", ja
"この Chief はこのデバイスでのみ記憶します。" (other languages per check-l10n.sh, by the view owner).
The note is removed when P2 lands shared memory.
