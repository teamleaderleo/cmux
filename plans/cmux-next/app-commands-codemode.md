# App commands, app MCP tools and code mode (R73)

Status: decided by the coordinator 2026-10-04 (section 5); not implemented. App commands + codemode lead. Request R73 (Lawrence, 2026-10-04): "we need to allow apps to bring over their own scoped cli commands, and mcp commands. we need to have first class support for codemode in cmux as well. and the mcp commands that people bring over need to be in codemode support too."

Binding: ONE-CATALOG, UI-STACK, REACT-PAGES, PASSWORDS (spec decisions.md), identity-and-permissions.md (spec), app-platform.md sections 12.5, 13, 15, pane-protocol.md (R60), mcp.md, code-mode.md, actions.md.

## 0. What exists today (read 2026-10-04 on feat-cmux-next c4b5e502139)

- App ops already declare surfaces. Every first-party catalog fragment (`first-party-apps/*/catalog/*.json`, schema `cmux-app-host/schema/v2/cmux-app-catalog.schema.json`) has per op `cli: {path, visible}` and `mcp: {expose: default|opt_in|never, group?}`, plus `risk`, `class`, `idempotency`, `input`/`output` JSON Schema. `cli.path` is free text: most are `apps run cmux/<app> <verb>`, remote desktop uses top-level `rd open`. The validator (`cmux-app-manifest`) checks no CLI or MCP rule. No Rust CLI verb and no MCP tool reads the fragments yet. There is no daemon app supervisor yet (`apps-v1` is a plan, section 13).
- `cmux mcp serve` (Rust, `cli/mcp/*`) gives one tool per curated resource op, browser host op and app action. It has no app-op tools.
- Code mode prototype (code-mode.md): `cmux docs search`, `cmux run <script.ts>`, and a Bun MCP server with `cmux_docs` + `cmux_exec`. The script runs in Bun under bwrap (Linux) or `sandbox-exec` (macOS) behind `proxy.mjs`, which allows a request when its op name is in the embedded catalog. Bun must be installed. The proxy does not know the caller, so there is no per-principal scope check, no confirmation, no audit and no app ops.
- Identity: the daemon has no actor on resource ops. identity-and-permissions.md section 5: "until the actor stamp lands, agent requests are attributed as plain CLI". Any agent in a cmux terminal can already run the full `cmux` CLI.
- Prior art. Codex code mode (`codex-rs/code-mode-*`, Apache-2.0): two tools `exec` (raw JS in a fresh V8 isolate, nested tools on a `tools` global, `text()`, `store/load`, `yield_control()`, `ALL_TOOLS` for search, `yield_time_ms` and `max_output_tokens` pragmas) and `wait {cell_id, yield_time_ms, max_tokens, terminate}`. Nested calls go back through the normal Codex tool router, so approvals apply per nested call. Cloudflare Code Mode: MCP schemas become a TypeScript API, the script runs in a Worker isolate whose only bindings are the API. The Home mux (PR 16279) uses a Worker Loader code mode in the cloud.

## 1. App CLI commands

Decision proposed (D1): two forms, both generated from the op declarations in the app's catalog fragment (no separate `contributes.cli` block: one catalog).

- Short form `cmux <cli-name> <verb...> [flags]`, for example `cmux notes capture --text "buy milk"`, `cmux rd connect --host mini`. `cli-name` is one new manifest field (`cli: {name}`, `^[a-z][a-z0-9-]{1,23}$`).
- Qualified form `cmux apps run <app-id> <verb...> [flags]`, for example `cmux apps run cmux/notes capture --text x`. It always works. Scripts, docs for agents and automations use it.

Why not `cmux app <id> <verb>`: `cmux app` is already the app-owned scope (`cmux app new-window`, cli.md), so an app id there would collide with action verbs. Why not only the short form: a later built-in noun or a second app could take the name. Rules:

1. Built-in nouns always win. The short form is resolved only after the built-in grammar fails to match the first word, so an app can never shadow or intercept a built-in command.
2. The validator refuses a `cli.name` in the reserved list (every current built-in noun and alias, plus reserved future words: `code`, `docs`, `apps`, `app`, `mcp`, `run`, `help`, `x`, ...; the list lives in one JSON next to `scope-classes.json`). The registry keeps listed `cli.name` values unique per publisher-verified listing.
3. Two installed apps with the same `cli.name` (local and dev apps): neither gets the short form, the CLI prints both qualified forms, and the App Store shows a warning row.
4. `cli.path` becomes the verb path relative to the app (`capture`, `session start`). Validator: unique per app, `^[a-z][a-z0-9-]*( [a-z][a-z0-9-]*){0,2}$`. Existing fragments are migrated in the same change (the `apps run cmux/<app>` prefix is dropped).

Arguments come from the op's `input` JSON Schema: each top-level property is `--kebab-name`; booleans are `--x/--no-x`; enums are checked and completed; arrays repeat the flag; nested objects take JSON (`--filter '{...}'`); `--args '{...}'` or `--args-file -` gives the whole object; `cli.positional: ["text"]` (optional, new) maps positionals. Required fields are checked locally; the owner validates again. `--json` prints the typed result.

Help: `cmux notes --help` and `cmux notes capture --help` are generated from `docs`, property `description` and the manifest `strings` (English and Japanese; the user's language picks). The help says the app name, the publisher and the scopes that the op needs.

Resolution at run time: the supervisor writes `installed-catalog.json` (merged fragments of installed and enabled apps, with a revision) atomically into its state dir. The CLI reads that file for parsing, help and completion, so completion never waits on a socket. The call itself goes to the supervisor (`apps-run` today, `cmux.apps.run` in the IR) with the caller's principal. A disabled, hidden-but-enabled or uninstalled app: hidden apps keep their commands; disabled and uninstalled apps answer `app.not_enabled` with the enable command.

Completion: `cmux completion zsh|bash|fish` (new if absent) calls `cmux __complete <words>` which reads built-in grammar plus `installed-catalog.json`.

Scopes: the op's scope (IR `scope`) is checked by the owner for the caller's principal, and the app's own grant is checked too (confused deputy rule, spec app-platform.md: an agent calling an app op runs with the intersection of the agent's grant and the app's grant).

## 2. App MCP tools

Same op declarations, same filter as code mode (section 4), in `cmux mcp serve`:

- Tool name: op full name with `.` and `-` as `_` (`notes_capture`, `acme_diff_open`). The merged registry refuses two ops with the same tool name (validator for one app; supervisor at install time for two apps: the second install shows the conflict and is refused until one is removed). Names longer than 48 characters (client prefixes take the rest of 64) are refused by the validator.
- Input schema: the op's `input`; description: `docs` plus "(app <name>)".
- Listed only while the app is installed and enabled and `mcp.expose` is `default`, or `opt_in` and the user turned it on for that agent class. `never` is never a tool and is never in code mode.
- `tools.listChanged`: the server already watches the app; it also watches `apps-changed {revision}` and sends `notifications/tools/list_changed`.
- Risky ops: see section 4 (native confirmation).

## 3. Code mode as a first-class surface

### 3.1 Surfaces

- MCP profile `cmux mcp serve --profile code` with three tools: `cmux_docs {query?, ops?}` (search when `query`; with `ops` it returns the TypeScript declarations of those ops and their types), `cmux_exec {script, timeout_ms?, yield_ms?, max_output_bytes?}` and `cmux_wait {cell, yield_ms?, terminate?}`. The names keep the two landed tools; `cmux_wait` follows Codex `wait` for long scripts.
- CLI: `cmux code run <file.ts | ->` (stdin script), `cmux code types [--ops ...]` (prints the generated `.d.ts` for the caller's view), `cmux docs search|describe` stays the discovery verb. D2: rename the unreleased `cmux run <script>` to `cmux code run`; `cmux run` is too valuable a word and `pane run`/`workspace run` already mean "run a shell command".
- The Home mux, automations `code` bodies (automations-runtime.md) and the CLI use the same daemon op (3.3), so there is one implementation.

### 3.2 The script API

The script sees one global `cmux`, generated from the merged registry: the IR (pane-protocol.json, including the cloud catalog input) plus the fragments of installed and enabled apps. v1 extends the landed generated TypeScript client with the merged registry ops (from `cmux-app-host/generated/ops.json` until emit-ir replaces it), so the script and the app host's `cmux` global share one op list; it is filtered to the caller's view. First-party ops are `cmux.workspace.list()`, `cmux.notes.capture({text})`; third-party ops are `cmux.app("acme.diff").open({...})`; `cmux.call(name, args)` is the untyped fallback. Helpers: `text()`, `json()`, `image()` (output items), `cmux.stream(op, args)` (async iterator over a stream op, bounded by the cell's limits), `args` (CLI positionals after `--`). No `fetch`, `require`, dynamic `import()`, timers beyond `setTimeout` bounded by the cell, filesystem, environment or process access.

The model reads types through `cmux_docs {ops}` (generated TSDoc from `docs`), not by loading the whole catalog (74k tokens today). The script is TypeScript; Bun strips types (no type check). A wrong argument fails at the owner's schema validation with a typed error that names the field, which the model can fix in the next exec.

### 3.3 Where code runs (D4)

In the daemon, not in the client. New ops owned by a `code` module of the daemon (cmux-tui-core): `cmux.code.exec {script, timeout_ms?, yield_ms?, max_output_bytes?, idempotency_key}` returns `{cell, state: done|running, output[], result?, error?}`; `cmux.code.wait {cell, yield_ms?}`; `cmux.code.cancel {cell}`; `cmux.code.cells.list` (the caller's cells). Reasons: the daemon is where the caller's principal is known and checked, it already runs on Macs, Linux servers and cloud VMs, cells survive a restarted MCP client, and the Home mux and automations reach it without a second runtime.

Every nested call from the script is dispatched by the daemon's normal op router with the principal of the connection that called `code.exec`, marked `origin: script`, `via: code_cell <id>`. The sandbox never sees the run token: the host-side proxy holds it (3.4). The script cannot widen its rights because its only way out is that router. App ops go to the supervisor like any other caller.

### 3.4 Sandbox (D3, decided: keep the Bun prototype for v1)

v1 keeps the landed runner: Bun under bwrap (Linux) or `sandbox-exec` (macOS), no host network, no host home, read-only runtime, one socket. QuickJS is not adopted now (a new memory-unsafe engine and an unbuilt host); revisit only with measured data. What changes:

- The daemon owns the lifecycle (D4): `cmux.code.exec` spawns the runner, the daemon waits, cancels, enforces limits and writes the audit. The CLI and MCP server only call the daemon op.
- The proxy becomes principal-bound. For each run the daemon mints a short-lived run token (`run_…`, expires with the cell, at most the cell's wall time) tied to the calling principal and the cell. The sandbox gets only the proxy socket; the proxy presents the run token, and the daemon router checks every call against that principal's scopes and the `agent_view` filter (section 4). A run token can never name another principal or outlive its cell. The op-name allowlist in `proxy.mjs` stays as a second check, not the authority.
- The script's catalog view is the merged registry (IR plus installed apps' fragments), so app ops are callable through the same client.

Engine comparison kept for the later revisit:

| Option | For | Against |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Bun + bwrap/sandbox-exec (v1) | works now on Linux and macOS | needs Bun on every host; bwrap needs user namespaces; `sandbox-exec` is deprecated |
| QuickJS-ng (app host engine) | about 1 MB, memory limit and interrupt handler, same engine as apps | interpreter; memory-safety CVE history; the Rust host is not built |
| V8 | fastest, mature isolate | 30-40 MB, fragile builds |
| JavaScriptCore | on every Mac | not on Linux servers |

Limits (defaults, settings under `code.*`): memory 256 MiB per cell (rlimit on the runner process), wall time 60 s (max 600 s), script 256 KiB, output 256 KiB per exec or wait answer (cut with `truncated`), 64 nested calls in flight, 4 running cells per principal, 16 per daemon, cells kept 10 minutes after they end. Cancellation (`code.cancel`, MCP `notifications/cancelled`, Ctrl-C in `cmux code run`, client disconnect for a CLI run, deadline): the daemon revokes the run token, sends `request.cancel` for nested calls in flight, sends SIGTERM and then SIGKILL after 2 s, and reports each in-flight mutation's state (`not_run`, `applied`, `in_progress` with its idempotency key).

Streaming: output items stream as they are produced: MCP `notifications/progress` with the text, `cmux code run` prints them as they come (NDJSON with `--json`), `cmux.code.exec` with `yield_ms` returns early with `state: running` and the items so far.

## 4. Security

One function decides agent exposure for every surface (CLI app commands for agent principals, MCP tools, code mode): `agent_view(op, principal) -> Offered | NeedsApproval | Excluded{reason}`. Its inputs are IR fields only (`scope`, risk class from `scope-classes.json`, `mcp.expose`, `secret_output`, owner) and the principal's grant. Tests run it over the whole merged registry.

- No secrets: excluded for every agent principal, in every surface, with a reason: password ops (PASSWORDS P2), `*:keys` scopes, credential handles, account connect and sign-in, grant and policy changes, install and uninstall, `cmux.apps.grant.set`, ops whose output schema has a field marked `x-cmux-secret` (new IR flag, request to hq-48). The script process has an empty environment.
- Confirmation: ops with risk `destructive`, `send-external`, `money` or a restricted scope need an approval when the actor is an agent: the daemon sends `approval.request {op, args summary, principal, cell}`; the user answers in a native sheet (Mac) or the Home approval part; the nested call waits (the cell reports `awaiting_approval` through `wait`); decline answers `approval.declined`; no answer in 10 minutes answers `approval.timeout`. "Allow for this session" creates a standing grant for that exact op and resource for that principal. A `confirm: true` argument from an agent is not an approval (D6).
- Audit: the daemon appends one record per nested call `{ts, principal, on_behalf_of, origin, cell, script_sha256, op, args_digest, status, duration_ms, approval?}` and one per cell with the full script text (bounded, 30 days, then deleted). Read with `cmux.code.audit.list` (user origin and the user's own clients only).
- The per-agent part depends on the actor stamp (D5). The worker's P8 lead builds actor recording (P8 slice 3a); this lead builds the agent-principal part on top, coordinated through the coordinator. Until it exists, agent-facing code mode (the `--profile code` MCP server and `cmux.code.exec` from agent principals) stays behind the debug flag `code.agentSurface` (default off).

## 5. Decisions (coordinator, 2026-10-04)

| # | Question | Decision |
| --- | --- | --- |
| D1 | App CLI form | short `cmux <cli-name> <verb>` + full `cmux apps run <app> <verb>`: yes |
| D2 | `cmux run <script>` | renamed to `cmux code run`: yes |
| D3 | Sandbox | keep the Bun prototype for v1; make the proxy principal-bound with a short-lived run token per run; no QuickJS now; revisit only with data |
| D4 | Lifecycle | the daemon spawns, waits, cancels and audits: yes |
| D5 | Actor stamp | P8 slice 3a records actors; this lead adds agent principals on top through the coordinator; agent-facing code mode behind a debug flag until then |
| D6 | Agent confirmation | native approval replaces `confirm: true` for agents: yes (matches REACT-PAGES Q4) |
| D7 | Default MCP profile | `--profile code` for agents cmux starts, with a setting (`mcp.profile = tools`) for the full tool list: yes |
| D8 | `fetch` in scripts | none in v1: yes |

## 6. Slices (red test commit first in each)

| # | Slice | Where | Red tests | Needs |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| S1 | Manifest: `cli.name`, relative `cli.path`, `cli.positional`, reserved names, tool-name length and collision rules; migrate fragments | `cmux-app-manifest`, schema v2, `first-party-apps/*/catalog` | invalid fixtures: reserved name, duplicate verb, tool name collision, too long | crate slot; app platform lead agrees the fields |
| S2 | `agent_view` exposure function over the merged registry | new module in `cmux-tui-core` (or crate `cmux-op-policy`) | password, keys and credential ops excluded; destructive needs approval; `never` excluded; disabled app excluded | cmux-tui window; IR fields from hq-48 |
| S3 | CLI app commands: resolution from `installed-catalog.json`, schema-to-flags, help, completion | `cmux-tui/src/cli/app_commands*` | `cmux notes capture --text x` builds the run params; built-in wins; collision prints qualified forms; enum and required checks | cmux-tui window; supervisor writes the file (app platform lead) |
| S4 | MCP app-op tools + `list_changed` on `apps-changed` | `cli/mcp/app_op_tools.rs` | parity: every exposed app op is a tool or an exclusion with a reason | cmux-tui window |
| S5 | Principal-bound runner: daemon spawns the Bun runner, run token per cell, proxy presents it, limits, cancel | `cmux-tui-core::code`, `scripts/cmux-next/cmux-code-mode-runner`, `proxy.mjs` | a run token cannot call an op its principal lacks; an expired or revoked token is refused; infinite loop stops at the deadline; cancel during an await; output cut | cmux-tui window |
| S6 | Daemon ops `cmux.code.exec/wait/cancel/cells.list/audit.list`, caller-principal dispatch, approvals, audit | `cmux-tui-core::code` | script cannot call an excluded op; approval decline fails the call; one audit record per nested call | cmux-tui window; IR entries (hq-48) |
| S7 | Surfaces: `cmux code run`, `cmux mcp serve --profile code` (default for agents cmux starts, `mcp.profile` setting, behind `code.agentSurface` until D5), `cmux_docs {ops}` d.ts; move the Bun MCP server's tools into the Rust `cmux mcp serve`; update `skills/cmux-code-mode` | CLI, scripts, skills | end-to-end: the four measurement tasks in code-mode-measurements.md | cmux-tui window |

S1 status: prepared on local branch `nx-app-commands-s1` (red tests, then the rules, `cli-reserved.json`, first-party fragments migrated to app-relative paths and given `cli.name` where the name is not reserved: `agents`, `coderouter` and `search` keep only the full form); waits for the crate slot and a Testbox run.

All Rust builds and tests run on a Blacksmith Testbox (approved). Slots: S1 gets a crate slot after the current freeze or hold; S2 gets the main window later.

## 7. Coordination

- App platform lead: `cli` block fields (S1), the supervisor's `installed-catalog.json` and install-time tool-name conflict check.
- P8 lead (worker): actor recording (slice 3a) is the base for agent principals (D5).
- hq-48 (pane protocol IR): per-op `scope`, `mcp.expose`, `cli`, `x-cmux-secret` in the IR; `cmux.code.*` ops declared with schemars; the TS generator emits the `.d.ts` that `cmux_docs {ops}` returns.
- Home lead and automations runtime: consume `cmux.code.exec` instead of a second runtime (the cloud mux keeps the Worker Loader until a cloud daemon serves the op).
- code-mode.md owner: v1 keeps their Bun runner; this plan moves its lifecycle into the daemon and binds the proxy to a principal.
