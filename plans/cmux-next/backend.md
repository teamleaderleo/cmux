# Backend lead: stage B resume note (parked 2026-10-02, Claude capacity 2/28)

Resume after the Oct 4 reset. Branch for stage B code: `backend-home-routes` (off feat-cmux-next; no code yet).

## In flight when parked

- https://github.com/manaflow-ai/cmux/pull/16861 (Home catalog): base merged in, generated catalog and client regenerated (106 ops), protocol index exports `ops-home.ts` and `ops-home-schemas.ts`. Self-reviewed (owners, risks, principals). Next: merge when the CI `test` check passes.
- https://github.com/manaflow-ai/cmux/pull/16859 (0006_home schema + projections): base merged in (3c6821bb240), migration lint and projection tests pass, label `backend:apply-migrations` added (applies to staging and production before merge). Next: confirm `apply-staging`, `apply-production` and `backend migrations applied` pass, then merge. Tables hold no raw address, secret or token hash; `home_message_search` holds message text for home.search (by design).

## Stage B order (approved by the coordinator)

1. Home HTTP routes: `ownerRoute` cases for cloud:ConversationDO (keyed by `params.id`/conversation, stripped from params), cloud:MuxDO (agent, principal through withGrantClasses for install_kind), cloud:planetscale (home.search through a read-only Hyperdrive); inbox ops to UserDO `submitInbox`/`readInbox`. Worker derivations: conversation id, invite_id, address id (HMAC HOME_ADDRESS_KEY), token_hash, proof. Endpoints `GET /v1/invites/card/<code>` (open invite only, never user-to-user DM; the staging card waits on this), `POST /v1/invites/preview`, invite.accept with acceptLocked; `/v1/wire/conv/<id>` (E5); DM peer lookup (Q2); approval rules.
2. UserDO: delegate `user.text_confirm.*` and `user.presence_key.*` to home-core `reduceUserConfirm` (env user, installActive, installKind, chiefs, appIdHash, locale); presence-key route (macOS: install-key signature; iOS: App Attest attestation, then submitSystem `user.presence_key.register`); `install.revoke` and `install.revoke_by_team` also commit `user.presence_key.revoke`.
3. MuxDO route with install_kind; confirm streams `mux:<agent>` and `user:<user>` (system:mux:<agent>, system:user:<user>); conversation-search `{query, limit 1-100}` in POST /v1/read; one `mux.text_confirm.migrate` pass per chief after re-pushing team/MDM locks (minimum-only semantics).
4. Lane 15 security follow-ups: per-account phone link limits (5/day, 2 numbers/day) with one uniform answer; link page rules (home-messaging.md section 19); SendBlue fetch-by-handle before acting on a webhook; relink notice to the previous account.
5. Stage-A P3 leftovers: readInbox checks installActive; inbox prune slack; bind entity only after auth.

Stage C (after B): MailerDO (wrangler tag v8) and the mail path for `mail.security_notice`; FeedDO accepts feed.post notices from UserDO; AddressDO sends (vCard first, text after SENT/DELIVERED, allow list fail-closed, HOME_INVITES_SEND kill switch, every staging send logged and reported).

Other open items: shared teams after stage C (plan in enterprise.md); verify the OIDC callback's Stack server calls on staging the next time auth changes; Effect 4.0.0 bump after 2026-10-08; integrations gateway after stage C.

## home.search role (search-ro2), 2026-10-03

The first role (search-ro) inherited pg_read_all_data, granted by pscale_admin, which our roles
cannot revoke. It was replaced on development and staging by `search-ro2`, created with no
inherited roles, and granted by the table owner (migrator):

```sql
-- run as the migrator role (table owner) on the cmux-next branch; <ro> = the search-ro2 Postgres role name (username before the dot)
GRANT USAGE ON SCHEMA public TO "<ro>";
GRANT SELECT ON TABLE public.home_participants, public.home_message_search, public.home_conversations TO "<ro>";
```

Steps per branch (confirm the branch with `pscale branch show cmux-next <branch> --org cmux` first):
1. `pscale role create cmux-next <branch> search-ro2 --org cmux` (no `--inherited-roles`); store the URL in
   `~/.secrets/cmux-next-planetscale-ro-<env>.env` (mode 600).
2. The SQL above as migrator.
3. Check: `pg_has_role(<ro>, 'pg_read_all_data', 'MEMBER')` = false, SELECT on home_message_search = true,
   SELECT on audit_events = false, INSERT on home_message_search = false; a live `SELECT 1 FROM audit_events`
   as the role fails with permission denied.
4. `wrangler hyperdrive update <id> --connection-string=<new url>` (dev cb712d90..., staging 10bbf30d...,
   production 6badee5c...).
5. `pscale role delete cmux-next <branch> <old search-ro id> --org cmux --force --successor postgres`.

Done: development and staging (all checks passed, Hyperdrives use search-ro2, old role deleted).
Production (branch main, Hyperdrive 6badee5cbb964e9f9c09c6f175a14c85): done 2026-10-03 after the
coordinator's C-BATCH decision (same SQL and checks; all passed; Hyperdrive uses search-ro2; old
role deleted with --successor postgres).
New projection tables that search reads need the same GRANT.

## Queue after stage B (coordinator C-BATCH, 2026-10-03)

1. Drizzle for schema and queries: generated SQL migrations committed, reviewed and applied through
   the backend:apply-migrations gate; a test proves the Drizzle schema equals today's database
   (introspect the scratch Postgres after all migrations and diff); raw SQL only where Drizzle is
   poor (home.search). Starts after conversation.import and the chief records (both done).
2. Stage C: MailerDO (tag at landing), AddressDO sends (vCard first, allow list fail-closed, kill
   switch, logged staging sends), invite limits, lane 15 phone-link rules, and
   `install.enroll_local` (the daemon enrolls as its own install per ownership-v2, with a
   narrowed grant: read and mutate-own on its own host objects, no send-external, money or
   destructive).
3. Automations dogfood hard cap: $25 per team per UTC month (automations lead enforces; backend
   reviews the meter).

## Drizzle, step 1 (2026-10-03)

`backend/db/schema/index.ts` is the Drizzle schema, pulled from the database the committed
migrations build; `test-pg/drizzle-schema.test.ts` pulls again in CI and fails on any difference
(checked: an added column fails it). `drizzle/` holds the generate snapshots (baseline 0000, never
applied); schema changes follow `backend/db/drizzle/README.md` and still land as reviewed
`migrations/NNNN_*.sql` through the apply gate. Not modeled: the hash-partitioned
`home_message_search` (raw SQL in 0006 and home-search.ts). Next steps: move the projection
writes (apps/api/src/projection.ts) and the other queries to Drizzle query builders, one table group
per commit, each with the existing tests.

## Production high availability (2026-10-03)

Approved by Lawrence through the coordinator (+$10/month). Confirmed cmux-next/main is the
production branch, then `pscale branch resize cmux-next main --replicas 2 --org cmux --wait`.
Change request wo8mbi6eghr0 completed: PS_5_AWS_ARM, replicas 0 -> 2 ("highly available",
$15/month instead of $5). Size kept at PS-5 (no headroom resize). The production API answered 200
after the change.

## Worker Loader binding (automations lead, 2026-10-03)

`worker_loaders: [{ binding: "LOADER" }]` is in every env block of backend/apps/api/wrangler.jsonc. Only Tier 1 code automations use it (backend/apps/api/src/code-run.ts, plans/cmux-next/automations-plan.md slice 3). The coordinator assigned this line to the automations lead while the backend lead is parked. Tenant Dynamic Workers get no bindings and no network (`globalOutbound: null`) until the egress gateway and env.cmux land (slice 4). `AutomationTail` (a WorkerEntrypoint export of the API Worker) is attached as their tail.

## Follow-ups from (e) instant revocation (P3, 2026-10-04)

- In-flight window: a request that joins an in-flight UserDO check after a revoke committed gets the old answer (one RPC). Accepted; a revoke epoch in the answer would close it if needed.
- Restored chief: a chief restored within its token life (10 min) makes the old token valid again. Fix: a chief generation number in ChiefRecord, carried as a token claim (`agg`), bumped on archive and restore; installGrant refuses a token whose generation differs.
- Rate budgets (reach): one total cap per owner across chiefs; a replay of a decided key after the limit returns the stored result; homeRateTake must not create storage in an unbound UserDO; dm.open with a user peer counts against the conversation.create budget.

## (f) TeamDO members out of the head, paging, membership index (design, 2026-10-04)

Today TeamDO is JSON mode: `members` and `hosts` are maps in the one state row (2 MB), and only personal teams exist (one member, written by team.ensure_personal). Q5 needs 10k+ member teams at launch.

1. Engine: `Domain.authorize` gets a read-only row reader as a fifth argument (row-mode owners only; JSON owners get EMPTY_ROWS), so authorization can read member rows without the head.
2. TeamDO moves to row mode (snapshotTable `member`, snapshotTail 0): members are rows `member/<user>` {user, role, display_name}, hosts rows `host/<id>`. The head keeps team, policy (current version only; history stays in audit_events), counts (`member_count`, `host_count`) and the small maps. Row-mode effects carry writes, so subscribers mirror effects and never replay the reducer.
3. Every `state.members[...]` reader (team.ts, team-reads.ts, team-do.ts, team-ssh-ca.ts, team-sso-external.ts, team-domain-external.ts, team-servers.ts, team-visibility.ts, team-ssh.ts) takes a `memberOf(user)` lookup bound to the rows. One-time migration on wake: if the head still has `members`/`hosts`, write them as rows and drop the maps in one commit (system op `team.rows_migrate`).
4. Paging: `team.directory` becomes `team.members.list {cursor?, limit<=200, role?}` and `team.hosts.list {cursor?, limit}` (keyset on user id / host id), plus `team.directory` kept as the first page for old clients. Members are also projected to PlanetScale (`membership.upsert` already exists) for filtered admin listing.
5. UserDO membership index (DM reach, spec 16.7): every membership write emits an E4 outbox item `user.team_index {team, role|null}` to the member's UserDO, which keeps a private table `team_index(team, role)`; read `user.teams` (internal RPC `homeTeamsOf(user)`) returns all teams the user belongs to, multi-member Stack teams included. The reach rule calls it for both users and intersects.
6. Tests first: a 12k-member team commits with a head under 100 KB; authorize reads rows; paging is stable under inserts; the index follows add, role change and removal; the migration is idempotent on a live DO.

Rollback note for (f) steps 2-3 (security review P2): code before 3e "TeamDO members and hosts in rows" reads `state.members[x]` and `Object.values(state.hosts)` and throws on a migrated head (no maps), so every TeamDO op fails closed. TeamDO is forward-fix only after this lands; a rollback deploy needs a build that keeps the row lookups. The migration key carries the head seq, so a head that a rollback refilled with maps migrates again.

Rollback-safe build recipe for TeamDO (after (f) steps 2-3). A rollback must never deploy a TeamDO that reads only the maps.
1. Start from the commit you want to roll back to: `git checkout -b rollback-<date> <target>`.
2. Cherry-pick the row lookups, in order: the ownership commit "authorize gets a read-only row reader in row mode", then "TeamDO members and hosts in rows, one member lookup, live migration", "team events carry only the member view", and "SSH CA issuance reads host rows". Resolve conflicts in favor of `memberOf`/`roleOf`/`hostOf`/`hostByInstall` from `domains/team-members.ts`; keep `rowMode` and `redact` in the TeamDO constructor.
3. Gates: `bun run typecheck`, `bun run lint:size`, `bun run catalog:check`, and the full backend suite on mini-6 (`nx-remote --ref <sha> -- 'cd backend && bun install --frozen-lockfile && bun run test'`), plus `test/team-members-rows.test.ts` on its own.
4. Deploy that build. Migrated heads keep working (rows first); a head that the old build refilled with maps migrates again on the next bind (the key carries the head seq).
