# cmux next: one Ghostty (ghostty-next) and pluggable terminal backends

Status: proposal (ghostty-next lead, 2026-10-04). Inputs: Lawrence
2026-10-04 ("switch ghostty of cmux-next completely to manaflow-ai/ghostty-next",
"make ghostty manual IO backend generalizable", "allow cmux apps to bring
over custom backends"), coordinator R71, ghostty-next.md (lane 13),
cloud-ios.md, cloud-parity.md, app-platform.md section 12, the 2026-10-02
inventories in `.cmux-scratch/nx-worker/ghostty-next/`
(`fork-patch-inventory.md`, `vt-port-list.md`).

## 0. Summary

1. Where things are today on feat-cmux-next (`c4b5e50213`):
   - cmux-tui already builds libghostty-vt from the `ghostty-next` gitlink
     (`31627e4b9`, `crates/ghostty-vt-sys/build.rs`); there is no fallback
     to `ghostty`.
   - iOS already links GhosttyNextKit release `ios-v5` (`74e97632d4`)
     through SwiftPM `binaryTarget(url:checksum:)`.
   - Only the Mac app still uses `manaflow-ai/ghostty`: `CmuxNextTerminal`
     (29 files `import GhosttyKit`) links `GhosttyKit.xcframework`, which
     `scripts/download-prebuilt-ghosttykit.sh` / `ensure-ghosttykit.sh`
     produce from the `ghostty` gitlink (`b1a49b6015`).
   So the switch is the Mac app only, plus removing the `ghostty` gitlink
   from feat-cmux-next. `main` (the shipping app) keeps `manaflow-ai/ghostty`.
2. First principle: the cmux-tui session host owns the PTY, the parser state
   that answers queries, scrollback, the canonical grid and snapshots. The
   app's Ghostty surface only renders and encodes input
   (`GHOSTTY_SURFACE_IO_MANUAL_MIRROR`). So the app needs a renderer plus an
   input encoder, and almost none of the desktop fork's PTY, process,
   replay, embedding and theme-picker work.
3. The Mac app needs 7 small fork C APIs that ghostty-next lacks (section
   1.3), one ABI adaptation (clipboard callbacks), and the switch from
   `set_grid_size` + `restore_kitty_replay` + "new surface on resize" to
   ghostty-next's `set_grid` + `restore_snapshot` over the existing cmux-tui
   capability `terminal-snapshot-v1`.
4. Upstream sync is a merge, not a rebase, because cmux pins ghostty-next
   `main` commits. First sync done: ghostty-next PR
   https://github.com/manaflow-ai/ghostty-next/pull/13 (clean merge of
   upstream `f96c9711b`, 10 commits).
5. Terminal backends (R71): the backend layer is a Rust trait in cmux-tui.
   The surface talks one viewer protocol to a session host, whatever the
   backend. Two interfaces: `cmux.terminal.backend/1` (a process byte pipe;
   the local host parses) and `cmux.terminal.connector/1` (the far end runs
   its own session host, for example a Cloud VM; the local host relays it).
   Both declare `options.kinds`, default deny. Proven by the Cloud app and a
   sample SSH app.

## 1. Patch inventory

### 1.1 manaflow-ai/ghostty (desktop fork) versus upstream

Fork `origin/main` `9e0f0bb674` (2026-10-03): 539 non-merge commits ahead of
upstream, 1,398 behind, merge base `ab0b9da9e8` (2026-07-22). The cmux-next
pin `b1a49b6015` is 510 ahead. Group counts are from the 2026-10-02
inventory (530 commits) plus a re-check of the 29 commits since then.
Verdicts are for cmux-next (Mac and iOS mirror surfaces, cmux-tui host).

| Group (count) | What it is | Example SHAs | cmux-next verdict | Why |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| A1 manual IO (7) | `Manual.zig` backend, `process_output`, `io_write_cb`, MANUAL_MIRROR reply suppression, `text_input` | `d631f36cea`, `22fa801f88`, `581dbf264f` | already redone in ghostty-next | ghostty-next re-ported them on upstream with tests and a stricter reply list (5522, clipboard_read). |
| PTY tee (4) | Mac producer tees PTY bytes to the phone | `8bfc3b0263`, `365fe1d2cc`, `14ce6dbd30` | drop | The app has no PTY. cmux-tui is the only producer. |
| A2 render-now, render queue bounds, redraw tickets, tokened presentation (~74) | iOS render workarounds and frame-exact presentation | `66c3bc6f14`, `2b74a38fe8`, `d303f9c89e` | drop; presentation callback deferred | Root cause was the libxev iOS machport bug; upstream's libxev pin fixes it. ghostty-next has the non-blocking mailbox (D4). Presentation callbacks return only if verified replay needs frame-exact acks. |
| A4 config/theme (12) | `config_load_string`, padding `c_get`, `update_theme_config` | `f7880c4731`, PR 251, `c052c1450d` | port `config_load_string` and padding `c_get`; drop `update_theme_config` | The Mac app uses both (section 1.3). The Mac uses `update_config`. |
| A5 render-grid JSON (13) | test-only grid export | `4cc0933cfa` | drop | Verification only. GHOSTSNP READY digests replace it. |
| A6 Kitty replay restore (17) | `ghostty_surface_restore_kitty_replay` | `543a284553` | redo as GHOSTSNP restore + on-screen Kitty image replay (D3) | ghostty-next has `restore_snapshot`; cmux-tui has `terminal-snapshot-v1`. |
| B1 terminal semantics (9 + 4 since) | OSC 133 prompt on its own line, padding before a prompt, clear_screen order, stale prompt marks | `e1b8bf5f47`, `1975783f42`, `33620abfb1`, `431f5fea06` | port to ghostty-next (both lib-vt and app) with the fork tests red first | Parser behavior. cmux-tui moved to ghostty-next without it, so the host already lost these fixes. One port fixes host and viewers at once and keeps snapshots byte-equal. |
| B2 fonts (20) | NFD Hangul, CJK fallback width (PR 233), null CoreText names, RTL (itijah) | `3fbdd078df`, `3a7fc92309`, `0068ece733`, `ff362c99c0`, `e099e32efe` | port Hangul, CJK width, CoreText names; defer RTL | Viewer-only drawing, visible to Japanese and Korean users. RTL adds a dependency (`manaflow-ai/itijah`). |
| C VT replay formatter, lib-vt producer API (28) | formatter fixes, Kitty limits and cursors, cursor activity | `533c27ae1c`, `b7feeea5c0`, `71ed4f8f6f` | already redone in ghostty-next (round 1 and 2) | cmux-tui uses them through ghostty-next today. |
| D1 Electron, Windows, offscreen, EGL (21 + 13 since) | other embedders | `2b42e89227`, `f6b196135a`, `b1c147b47d` | drop | Not cmux-next. |
| D2 theme picker CLI (30) | `src/cli/list_themes.zig` | `66ff6ec4d0` | drop | cmux-next Settings owns themes. |
| D3 tmux control mode, write_active_file (14) | | `ed123a8c09` | drop; remove the app's tmux callback | cmux-tui owns multiplexing. |
| D4 link detection (39) | wrapped links, file paths, cmd-click | `eb9004aa8e`, `46428d790c` | drop; port single fixes only on a dogfood repro | Upstream has link detection and OSC 8. |
| D5 desktop renderer lifecycle (83) + D7 display link and resize (6) | hidden-tab GPU release, Metal sharing, frame lease, live resize | `517a4c75ad`, `a3588ac53d` | drop; dogfood gate (section 5, S2) | Upstream `c4e16970a8` releases GPU for hidden surfaces. A mirror's grid comes from the host, so view resize no longer reflows locally. Risk: live-resize and many-tab regressions show only in dogfood. |
| Unfocused 30 FPS pacing (PR 234) | `edefce7785` | | port if S2 profiling shows idle GPU cost with many tabs | Measured need, not default. |
| D6 PTY teardown, shell integration env, crash subdir, argv surfaces (46 + 2) | | `5b20c62297`, `aef980e27b`, `1f68f61057` | drop | No process in the app. `-Dcrash-report-subdir` is fork-only. |
| D8 input, selection, clipboard (63) | keyboard copy API, bounded copy, clear selection, grid metrics, font size callback, font query, OSC 99, prompt input (PRs 235/237/238) | | port the 5 APIs the Mac uses (section 1.3); drop the rest | Copy mode, find and font zoom are cmux-next features. OSC 99 belongs to the host (it parses notifications). Prompt input is not used by cmux-next. |
| E1 already upstream (19), E2 superseded (9), F reverts and syncs (20) | | | drop | |

### 1.2 ghostty-next versus upstream

`main` `31627e4b9` = upstream `83edd491e3` + 53 commits, all listed with
reasons in ghostty-next `NEXT.md`. All keep:

- Build: iOS slices revert (`7a171895dd`), `ios` xcframework target,
  `-fblocks`, GhosttyNextKit module name, CI pipeline, release plan.
- Remote IO: manual backend, mirror reply suppression, C API, text input,
  threading contract, Kitty in-band only, clear/reset left to the owner.
- Host-owned grid and snapshots: `set_grid`, `restore_snapshot`,
  `encode_snapshot`, hardened history, scrollback limits across restores.
- Renderer: non-blocking surface calls (D4), GPU completions never wait for
  the app mailbox, iOS 72 DPI, IOSurfaceLayer detach, bounded hide wait.
- lib-vt producer ports for cmux-tui (round 1 and 2).
- Behavior differences (OSC 7 raw URL, `shell_redraws_prompt = false`,
  live scrollback limits) apply to MANUAL modes only.

Only the build revert, 72 DPI and the IOSurfaceLayer sublayer fixes are
iOS-only; the rest applies to the Mac surface unchanged.

### 1.3 C API the Mac app uses that ghostty-next lacks

Token scan of `CmuxNextTerminal` (334 identifiers) against ghostty-next
`include/ghostty.h`:

| API | Mac use | Verdict |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `ghostty_config_load_string` | theme, keybind, padding config lines | port (26 lines, fork `f7880c4731`) |
| `ghostty_config_get` for `window-padding-x/-y` as `ghostty_config_window_padding_s` | `GhosttyRuntime+Padding.swift` | port (fork PR 251) |
| `ghostty_surface_grid_metrics` | copy-mode cursor box | port |
| `ghostty_surface_clear_selection` | copy mode, find | port |
| `ghostty_surface_copy_selection_to_clipboard_bounded` | copy mode | port |
| `ghostty_surface_set_font_size_action_callback` | per-tab font zoom record | port |
| `ghostty_surface_keyboard_copy_*`, `ghostty_surface_keyboard_selection_move` | copy mode (vim keys) | port (largest, about 400 lines with tests); upstream `adjust_selection` moves a selection only and has no copy cursor |
| `ghostty_surface_set_grid_size` | daemon grid | replace with `ghostty_surface_set_grid(cols, rows, generation)` |
| `ghostty_surface_restore_kitty_replay`, `kitty_graphics_limits`, `kitty_image_alias`, `kitty_image_id_cursor_state` | reattach and resize replay | replace with `restore_snapshot` over `terminal-snapshot-v1` |
| `ghostty_tmux_event_e` callback | ignored | delete the callback |
| clipboard callbacks (`read_clipboard_cb` result enum and MIME list, `confirm_read_clipboard_cb` struct, `complete_clipboard_request` struct) | `TerminalClipboardRequests.swift` | adapt Swift to upstream ABI |

## 2. Upstream sync

- Method: merge upstream `main` into `sync/upstream-<date>` in
  manaflow-ai/ghostty-next, update `next/UPSTREAM_BASE`, land by PR. Never
  rebase `main`. Reason: the cmux gitlink and every GhosttyNextKit release
  commit must stay ancestors of `main` (submodule pointer safety). A rebase
  would orphan `31627e4b9` (pinned by feat-cmux-next) and `74e97632d4`
  (iOS release commit). The old NEXT.md said "rebase"; PR 13 changes it.
  When the stack needs a clean replay, rebase on a side branch, then
  `git merge -s ours <old main>` so the old tip stays an ancestor.
- Done: PR 13 merges upstream `f96c9711b` (2026-10-04). Clean. The upstream
  delta touches only `src/cli/ssh*`, macOS `TerminalController.swift` and
  VOUCHED, so the ABI is unchanged. CI (`next-xcframework.yml`, Blacksmith
  macOS runner) builds it; the upstream remote push URL is disabled.
- Cadence: one sync PR per week, or when an upstream change touches
  `src/terminal`, `src/termio`, `src/renderer`, `src/apprt/embedded.zig` or
  `include/`. Each sync runs the patch tests and the iOS render smoke.
- A gitlink bump in feat-cmux-next lands only after the target commit is on
  ghostty-next `main` (`git merge-base --is-ancestor <sha> origin/main`).

## 3. Terminal backends (R71)

### 3.1 Layers

```
Ghostty surface (Mac, iOS)  MANUAL_MIRROR: render + encode input only
        |  viewer protocol: snapshot (GHOSTSNP) + bytes out; input, viewport, presence, focus in
cmux-tui session host       parser, grid, scrollback, snapshots, journal, hooks, attribution
        |  TerminalBackend / TerminalConnector traits (Rust)
backends (bytes): local-pty | app:<app>/<id>     connectors (host): cmux-tui link | app:<app>/<id>
```

Rules:

1. The surface has one production input: the viewer protocol of a session
   host. Today that is raw v12 `attach-surface` with
   `terminal-snapshot-v1` (local socket, or the link socket for a remote
   host). Lane 12's `terminal_bytes` channel carries the same frames. Swift
   `TerminalIO` stays as the in-process seam; its production
   implementation is the session-host viewer client. `LocalPTYTerminalIO`
   and `ScriptedTerminalIO` stay debug and test only.
2. No backend code runs in the app process or touches Ghostty. App code runs
   in the app host (its server), behind the session host.
3. A backend never sees other terminals and never decides the grid. The
   session host computes the grid (smallest policy) and tells the backend.

### 3.2 Two interfaces (decided 2026-10-04 with the Cloud app lead)

The two modes have different message sets and different trust, so they are
two interfaces, not one schema with a mode field:

| Interface | Mode | Far end | Local session host | Users |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `cmux.terminal.connector/1` | host | runs its own session host (parser, grid, snapshots) | relays the viewer protocol; does not parse | Cloud machines, cmux-tui over the link |
| `cmux.terminal.backend/1` | bytes | a process byte pipe | parses, owns snapshots, journal, grid | `local-pty`, sample SSH app, Cloud rescue shell |

Both declare `options.kinds`: an array of localId strings, 1 to 16, unique
(for example `cloud-vm`, `ssh`). The daemon refuses `connect` or `open` for
a kind that the manifest does not declare (default deny).

### 3.3 Rust traits (cmux-tui-core, module `terminal_backend`)

One registry maps namespaced ids (`local-pty`, `app:<app id>/<id>`) to a
connector or a backend.

```rust
pub trait TerminalBackend: Send + Sync + 'static {          // cmux.terminal.backend/1
    fn id(&self) -> &BackendId;
    fn kinds(&self) -> &[LocalId];                           // options.kinds; others refused. LocalId: ^[a-z][a-zA-Z0-9-]{0,63}$
    fn capabilities(&self) -> BackendCapabilities;
    async fn open(&self, req: OpenRequest) -> Result<Box<dyn ByteTerminal>, BackendError>;
    async fn resume(&self, token: &ResumeToken) -> Result<Box<dyn ByteTerminal>, BackendError>;
}

pub trait ByteTerminal: Send {
    fn events(&mut self) -> BoxStream<'static, ByteEvent>;
    async fn write(&self, seq: u64, input: Bytes) -> Result<(), BackendError>; // seq orders chunks; bounded queue = backpressure
    async fn resize(&self, grid: Grid) -> Result<(), BackendError>;            // cols, rows, cell px
    async fn signal(&self, signal: Signal) -> Result<(), BackendError>;         // capability `signals`
    async fn close(&self, how: Close) -> Result<(), BackendError>;
    fn resume_token(&self) -> Option<ResumeToken>;                             // capability `resume`
}

pub enum ByteEvent {
    /// `offset` is the stream offset after this chunk (running byte total
    /// since open). The session host checks continuity: a gap or overlap
    /// is `Lost`, never silently spliced. A resumed terminal continues the
    /// same offsets.
    Output { offset: u64, bytes: Bytes },
    Exit(ExitStatus),
    Lost { reason: String, retryable: bool },
}

pub struct ExitStatus {
    pub code: Option<i32>,      // exit code, when the far end sent one
    pub signal: Option<String>, // signal name without "SIG" ("INT", "KILL"), SSH exit-signal or POSIX
    pub core_dumped: bool,
    pub message: Option<String>, // bounded (4 KiB) far-end text, shown, never parsed
}

pub enum BackendError {
    Unsupported,
    Unavailable { reason: String, retryable: bool },
    /// Typed host-key refusal: the host shows its accept sheet from these
    /// fields, never by parsing text. Nothing reached the far shell.
    HostKey { decision: HostKeyRefusal /* Unknown | Changed */, fingerprint: String /* "SHA256:…" */ },
    Denied { reason: String },  // a handle was revoked or a check failed
    Invalid { reason: String },
}

pub struct BackendCapabilities {
    pub resize: bool, pub signals: bool, pub exit_status: bool, pub resume: bool,
    pub cwd_reports: bool, pub max_write_bytes: u32,
    /// True only when the far end answers terminal queries itself (DA, DSR,
    /// OSC color queries). Then the local session host parses but does not
    /// reply, or the far end would get two answers. A plain shell over SSH
    /// or a PTY is false: the session host answers.
    pub answers_queries: bool,
}
```

```rust
pub trait TerminalConnector: Send + Sync + 'static {        // cmux.terminal.connector/1
    fn id(&self) -> &BackendId;
    fn kinds(&self) -> &[LocalId];
    async fn connect(&self, req: ConnectRequest) -> Result<Box<dyn HostLink>, BackendError>;
}

pub trait HostLink: Send {
    // Viewer protocol of the far session host: snapshot_ready / history /
    // bytes / digest frames, size state, terminal list changes.
    fn frames(&mut self) -> BoxStream<'static, ViewerFrame>;
    async fn send(&self, msg: ViewerMessage) -> Result<(), BackendError>; // input, viewport, presence, focus
}
```

- `OpenRequest`: kind, terminal id, command (argv or default shell), cwd,
  env (allowlist), initial grid, `connection` handle, actor.
  `ConnectRequest`: kind, `connection` handle, actor.
- `BackendCapabilities`: `resize`, `signals`, `exit_status`, `resume`,
  `cwd_reports`, `max_write_bytes`.
- Snapshots: a backend never needs a VT parser; the local session host owns
  snapshots and journal. A connector serves GHOSTSNP from the far host;
  a version mismatch falls back to byte replay as `terminal-snapshot-v1`
  does today. After a session host restart the journal holds `{id, resume
  token}`; `resume` reattaches, or the terminal shows exited with the
  reason.
- Flow control: one bounded queue per direction. A full output queue stops
  reading from the backend (backpressure), never drops bytes; viewers keep
  their own credit and resync by snapshot (ghostty-next.md 2).
- `local-pty` (today's `cmux-pty` spawn path) becomes the first backend, so
  the trait is proven by the existing tests before any app backend exists.
  The link to a remote cmux-tui becomes the first connector.

Data plane (2026-10-04, from the SSH sample): bytes never move as op
calls. Every channel (a terminal's output and input, a host SSH channel, a
connector link) carries ordered `data {channel, offset, bytes}`, `credit
{channel, direction, bytes}` and one final `end {channel, exit? | lost?}`
frames. The receiver grants credit; the sender never sends past it (a
violation ends the channel with `lost {reason: "credit"}`). Windows start at
`window_bytes` from the open answer (64 KiB to 1 MiB, default 256 KiB). The
session host grants a backend output credit only while viewers and the
journal keep up, and a backend grants host-channel credit only from that, so
a slow viewer stops the far end instead of growing a buffer. In Rust the
`events()` stream and `write` above map onto these frames in the app host
bridge. The session host picks the terminal id (`open {terminal, ...}`); a
kind outside `options.kinds` fails with `denied`.

### 3.4 App-provided backends and connectors (manifest v2)

- Ownership: the ghostty-next lead owns both interface schemas
  (`cmux-tui/crates/cmux-app-host/interfaces/cmux.terminal.backend/1.json`,
  `.../cmux.terminal.connector/1.json`) and the Rust traits. The app
  platform lead owns the manifest schema and the `terminal:backend` scope.
- Manifest: `implements: [{"interface": "cmux.terminal.backend/1", "id":
  "ssh", "title": <localized>, "options": {"kinds": ["ssh"]}}]`. Ids are
  namespaced `app:<app id>/<id>`.
- Implementation: the app's server (native or JS). The app host bridges
  JSON control messages and binary frames to the traits.
- Scope: restricted scope `terminal:backend` for both interfaces, plus a
  `connection` handle per terminal or link (V6). Secrets stay in a
  `credential` handle.
- Consent: the user creates the terminal or link with a gesture (connect
  sheet or command); the backend gets only that terminal. Revoke closes
  every terminal and link of the app and drops its resume tokens
  (terminals show "disconnected: backend revoked").
- The terminal record carries the backend or connector id and display name
  (tab and Info pane). Hooks, agents and notifications work unchanged.
- Proof, in parallel (R71): the Cloud app (Cloud app lead) implements
  `cmux.terminal.connector/1` with kind `cloud-vm` (Cloud machines keep their
  own session host) and `cmux.terminal.backend/1` for its rescue shell; the
  sample `samples/apps/ssh-terminal` implements `cmux.terminal.backend/1`
  with kind `ssh`.

### 3.5 Handle operations that use secrets (security first)

A backend never receives a secret and no host op signs or decrypts bytes
that the app chose. A generic `sign(bytes)` on a credential handle would be
a signing oracle, and even a narrow SSH user-auth signature op leaves a
login-elsewhere risk (the host cannot prove that the session id belongs to
a key exchange with the handle's host while the app runs the transport).
Decision 8 (coordinator, 2026-10-04): the host owns the SSH transport.

For a `connection` handle of kind `ssh`, the backend calls the host op
`connection.channel.open {connection, open_token, pty: {term, cols, rows},
command?}`. The host resolves the handle, dials, checks the host key that
the user pinned for that handle (an unknown or changed key fails with the
typed `hostKey {decision, fingerprint}` error, before any byte reaches the
shell), authenticates with the user's credential, opens a session channel
with a PTY and returns a byte channel (data, window change, signal, exit
status; `connection.channel.resize|signal|close`). The backend maps its own
`open`, `write`, `resize`, `signal` and `close` onto that channel. The host
issues `open_token` per open or resume after the user's gesture; host ops
refuse a missing, expired or reused token. There is no signing op in the
interface.

What an SSH app still adds: picking and grouping hosts, jump-host and
provisioning flows, per-host defaults; never transport or keys. The cmux
Cloud SSH sample moves to this channel model.

## 4. Mac switch plan

1. Package: `Packages/Shared/CmuxGhosttyKit` declares the single
   `binaryTarget(name: "GhosttyNextKit", url: <ghostty-next release>,
   checksum:)`. iOS (`ios/CmuxiOS/Package.swift`) and the Mac
   (`CmuxNext/Package.swift`) both depend on it, so one pin serves both and
   the workspace has one target of that name. `import GhosttyKit` becomes
   `import GhosttyNextKit` (29 files) and the bridge header `ghostty.h`
   follows.
2. Release flavor: ghostty-next adds flavor `apple-v6`
   (`-Dxcframework-target=universal`: macOS arm64 + x86_64, iOS, iOS
   simulator). Today's `ios` flavor has a host-native macOS arm64 slice
   only. Archives are already `lib`-prefixed, so
   `prefix-ghosttykit-archives.sh` is no longer needed and
   `CmuxNextTerminal` can get a SwiftPM test target that links.
3. Build: GhosttyNextKit is built by ghostty-next CI on a hosted Blacksmith
   macOS runner and downloaded by SwiftPM. The fleet (`cmux-ci build cmux`)
   resolves the package; it no longer runs `ensure-ghosttykit.sh` or Zig for
   cmux-next. `cmux-next.yml` drops the `ghostty` path filters and the
   prebuilt download steps. `cmux-tui` keeps building libghostty-vt from the
   `ghostty-next` gitlink; the gitlink and the release pin move together
   (same ghostty-next commit) so host and viewer parse alike.
4. Remove the `ghostty` gitlink from feat-cmux-next only after S2 dogfood
   passes (a separate commit). `main` is unaffected.
5. Rollback: revert the switch commit (one commit restores `GhosttyKit` and
   the old pin); the `ghostty` gitlink stays until step 4.

## 6. Decisions (coordinator, 2026-10-04)

1. Merge-based sync: approved. PR 13 merged (`f24cb8630`).
2. cmux-next ships for Intel Macs: `apple-v6` is macOS arm64 + x86_64
   (universal) plus iOS and iOS simulator.
3. Copy mode: port the fork keyboard copy API. Real size is about 2,800
   lines (fork PRs 154, 156, 157, 159 and the selection-tracking commits),
   and it changes `Screen` and `Selection`, which libghostty-vt also builds.
   It lands as its own ghostty-next PR (S1a-2) after the small APIs (S1a-1).
4. cmux-tui re-sends the on-screen Kitty images after a snapshot; no image
   loss on reattach or resize. New slice S3k (cmux-tui window).
5. Port the OSC 133 prompt fixes to ghostty-next (S1b).
6. Two interfaces, `cmux.terminal.backend/1` and
   `cmux.terminal.connector/1`, both with `options.kinds` and default deny.
7. No window-opening tests on the laptop. S2 Mac dogfood runs on
   cmux-lawrence-2.
8. The host owns the SSH transport for `ssh` connection handles; the
   backend gets a channel; the interface has no signing op (section 3.5).

Shortcuts taken in this proposal: no build ran; the Mac API gap is a token
scan, not a link; group counts reuse the 2026-10-02 inventory; D5/D7
desktop renderer fixes are dropped on the claim that upstream and the
mirror model cover them, which only S2 dogfood can prove.
