/// way to tell whose is whose, so the author has to survive both hops between
/// the response and the row: the list decode and the snapshot the row renders

/// `.serialized` because the network tests here drive the same process-global
/// `CloudRefreshURLProtocol.responses` as `VMClientReadCoalescingTests`, which
/// carries the trait for the same reason: a `reset()` landing between another
/// test's `configure` and its request start serves the wrong body. The trait
/// only orders this suite's own tests; the two suites do not overlap because CI
